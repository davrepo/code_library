Therefore:\n","\n","(a) $$\\frac{dY}{dx_1} = \\beta_1$$ - in this case, the change is constant which should make sense given the model is just a simple line\n","\n","(b) $$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_1} = \\beta_1$$ - this might look very similar to `(a)`, but notice that this is only a partial derivative. Why does it make sense that we have got again $$\\beta_1$$?\n","Try to checkout this [Geogebra applet](https://www.geogebra.org/m/ptzufvkv), for the function, you can for instance write `1 + 0.5x + 2y` which should give you a nice plane. Then tick y as constant.\n","You should then see how two planes intersect, i.e., you should see a line. One plane is the model, the other represents the fixed $$x_2$$. And this is the reason why we obtained exact same result as in `(a)`,\n","since we are again looking at a line which grows/decreases constantly. If you feel still bit unsure, I suggest you check this short [video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivatives/v/partial-derivatives-and-graphs) about how to interpret partial derivative. Overall, the answer is that by changing $$x_1$$, $$y$$ would be again affected in a constant manner.\n","\n","(c) $$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_2$$ - now it got more interesting since the partial derivative is no longer constant but depends on $$x_2$$. Again, if you use the above applet with the new model, you should see why. First of all, our model no longer looks like a plane, but rather looks bit more complex, yet it is still `linear`. (liear in its `coefficients`, but it is non-linear from a perspective of its features) Try to slide with the $$Y$$ (in our case this is $$x_2$$), you should be able to see how the intersection line changes. In other words, when we want to know how output changes if we change $$x_1$$, we have to take into consideration also where we are in terms of $$x_2$$ position. Therefore the rate of change in this case is `linear` as can also be deduced from the obtained partial derivative equation.\n","\n","(d) $$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_2 + 2\\beta_4x_1$$ - this is the most complex model which can also be seen from the Geogebra applet. In this case, not only the $$x_2$$ determines the rate of change but we also we have to consider position on $$x_1$$. This makes sense since the intersection is no longer a line but a `parabolla` which grows/decreases at different rates based on the $$x_1$$. Again, as can be seen from the first partial derivative of the model, the change of $$x_1$$ would translate into linear change in the output. \n","\n","I believe the main takeaway from this exercise is that the more complex model, the more is the output variable impacted by little changes in the given feature. You could see that for the model represented by plane, the rate of change was always constant, where as for the more complex models, the rate of change was linear depending on the input features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"32a13288d440494cb9fe44370fee7175","deepnote_cell_height":46.375,"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-callout","formattedRanges":[{"fromCodePoint":0,"marks":{"bold":true},"toCodePoint":10,"type":"marks"}],"is_collapsed":false,"tags":[]},"source":["> Exercise 5"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"9031b875f63048919ec096f7eac08433","deepnote_cell_height":425.546875,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[]},"source":["Explain how the design matrix would look in each model.\n","\n","**Solution**\n","\n","We know that the design matrix has $$n$$ rows depending on the number of samples, and $$p + 1$$ columns where $$p$$ denotes the number of features.
