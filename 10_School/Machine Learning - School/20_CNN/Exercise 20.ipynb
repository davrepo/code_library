To obtain each of these channels, we will need 3 filters (for each channel), therefore, per output channel we will have $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$ parameters.

Assuming each of these will be represented as an $32$-bit float which is 4 bytes, then all these parameters take $3'610'800$ bytes which is roughly $3'610'800/1000/1000 \\approx 3.45$ MB. \n","\n","Now, we need to answer the second subquestion, which is how much memory do the actual channels take? Again, let's go layer by layer:\n","\n","- **Convolutional layer 1:** we take as an input 3D array which has in total $3 \\times 200 \\times 300$ values. As an output, we obtain 100 channels, but of what what dimension?

This means that for each channel (RGB) we compute $100 \\times 150$ output and then we summarize these outputs into a single output of the same size, so per output channel we will therefore need $4 \\times 100 \\times 150$ values, which means going through the first convolutional layer will require:\n","\n","$\n","(3 + 1) \\times 100 \\times 150 \\times 100 = 6'000'000 \\text{ values}\n","$\n","\n","- **Convolutional layer 2:** similarly for this layer:\n","\n","$\n","(100 + 1) \\times 50 \\times 75 \\times 200 = 75'750'000 \\text{ values}\n","$\n","\n","- **Convolutional layer 3:** and finally for the last layer:\n","\n","$\n","(200 + 1) \\times 25 \\times 37 \\times 400 = 74'370'000 \\text{ values}\n","$\n","\n","So in total, if we wanted to fit all values into main memory, we would need:\n","\n","$\n","((6'000'000 + 75'750'000 + 74'370'000)\\times 4)/1000/1000 \\approx 624.5 \\text{ MB}\n","$\n","\n","Therefore, to answer our initial question completely, we would roughly need **628 MB of memory**. \n","\n","Recall that we have so far assummed that we simply use a single sample/image as an input, now another question might be:\n","\n","> how much memory will we actually need if we use 50 images as an input?\n","\n","This is fairly straightforward:\n","\n","$\n","624.5 \\times 50 + 3.5 \\approx 31 \\text{ GB}\n","$\n","\n","With all of this being said, it feels like our CNN is missing something since we want to reduce the memory consumption if possible because otherwise it would be fairly difficult to train CNNs with such architectures.
