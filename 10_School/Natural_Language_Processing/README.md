## About
In this repository, you can find my course work for the subject **Second Year Project (Introduction to Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning)** taken at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk/). Here is a quick overview:

- [Week 1](coursework/01): Regular expression, command line
- [Week 2](coursework/02): Annotation and POS tagging, Generative and Discriminative Classification
- [Week 3](coursework/03): Sequence Prediction with HMMs, Language Identification with a Feedforward Neural Network
- [Week 4](coursework/04): What do word embeddings represent, Implement the continuous bag of words model for estimating word embeddings 
- [Week 5](coursework/05): POS tagging with an RNN, Bi-LSTM for language classification
- [Week 6](coursework/06): Elmo, Bert
- [final project](https://github.com/ludekcizinsky/plstream-lang-capabilities):
  includes both the chosen project as well as necessary pre-project work
- [notes](https://ludekcizinsky.notion.site/3ca877f373ae4c699fe9f219f8741f0f?v=715ac84d112e41849cd61e292238a044):
  if you want to improve them, let me know and I can share edit access
