# ------------------ Writing a file ----------------------------------------
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects

# f.write(string) writes the contents of string to file
    # returns the num of chars written

# Creating a file
# with keyword handles resource deallocation automatically, 
# i.e. do not need finally clause to close the file
with open('accounts.txt', mode='w') as accounts:
    accounts.write('100 Jones 24.98\n')
    accounts.write('200 Doe 345.67\n')

# ------------------ Reading a file ----------------------------------------


#Reading a file
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects

# read(size: int) reads size byte of text into a single string. 
    # if size omitted, reads the entire file. Size can be more than your memory. 
# readline() reads a single line incldue a newline char into a string
# readlines() - returns a list of every line also include newlines
    # same as list(f)


with open('accounts.txt', mode='r') as accounts:
    print(f'{"Account":<10}{"Name":<10}{"Balance":>10}')
    # Looping through file object, reads one line at a time, returns it as a string
    # is the most efficient method of all
    for record in accounts:    
    #split() delimiter is ' ' by default, and automatically discard newline character
        account, name, balance = record.split()     
        print(f'{account:<10}{name:<10}{balance:>10}')
# Account   Name         Balance
# 100       Jones          24.98
# 200       Doe           345.67

#accounts.readlines() can also read entire text file, returns each line as a string
# in a list of strings. But inefficient compared to for loop, 
# bc must complete before you can begin using the list of strings
with open('accounts.txt', mode='r') as accounts:
    for record in accounts.readlines():
        account, name, balance = record.split()     
        print(f'{account:<10}{name:<10}{balance:>10}')
# 100       Jones          24.98
# 200       Doe           345.67
